1995,
_la

published
a
satirical
article
suggesting
that
the
presence
of
president
henri
konan
b
edie
brought
bad
luck
to
the
ivoirien
soccer
team
when
he
attended
the

which
the
local

sentenced
to
a
two-year
prison
term

c
ote
d'ivoire
confirmed
the
two-year
jail
sentences
imposed
on
the
three
journalists.
they
are
now
appealing
to
the
supreme
court.
"president
bedie's
attack
on
the
_la
voie_
journalists
was
his
first
official
act
towards
the
private
press,
just
months
after
being
elected
to
office,
and
firmly
establishing
his
government's
continued
intolerance
for
press
freedom,"
says
kakuna
kerina,
program
coordinator
for
africa.
"during
his
campaign,
bedie
routinely
imprisoned
journalists
and
banned
private
newspapers,
thus
effectively
outlawing
free
expression
in
cote
d'ivoire."
since
president
b
edie
took
office
in
december
1993,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
prosecutions
against
independent
journalists
which
have
resulted
in
sentences
of
up
to
three
years
imprisonment.
physical
attacks
on
ivoirien
journalists
have
also
occurred:
in
june
1995,
mr.
**sangar
e**
was
savagely
beaten
by
four
policeman
at
the
order
of
security
minister
general
ouassenan
kone
for
an
article
he
wrote
in
the
satirical
weekly,
_bol
kotch_
,
about
the
minister's
treatment
of
student
unrest
in
the
country.
the
beating
took
place
in
minister
kone's
office,
and
in
his
presence.
cpj
contends
that
the
sentences
handed
down
against
**sangar
e**,
**kor
e**
and
**neruda**
are
unjustified
and
excessive.
having
previously
protested
these
convictions
to
president
b
edie
on
numerous
occasions,
cpj
reiterates
its
calls
for
the
reversal
of
the
journalists'
convictions,
and
****
their
immediate,
****
unconditional
release.
