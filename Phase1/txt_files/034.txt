summer
salads
what
can
be
more
appetizing
on
a
hot
summers
day
than
a
plateful
of
crisp,
colourful
vegetables.
salads
offer
a
great
way
of
incorporating
essential
omega
3
fatty
acids
by
using
cold-pressed
oils
such
as
flax,
canola,
soybean
or
walnut
in
dressings.
when
used
as
main
dishes,
they
can
also
include
a
light
source
of
protein,
such
as
sprouted
beans,
or
nuts
and
seeds.

selecting
vegetable
oils
for
salads

oil:
the
full-bodied,
first

chemicals
or

is
the
best.

be
lighter

who
dont
eat
fish.
available
in
natural
food
stores,
the
best
and
richest
form
is
cold

the

be
dark

look
for
the
expiry
date
and
always
refrigerate,
or
freeze
for
longer
periods.
cold-pressed
oils
should
not
be
heated
excessively,
and
are
best
used
with
salads,
and
on
cooked
vegetables
or
grains.
the
wonderful
flax

and

the
dairy
industry
has
bought
a
large
soy
milk
company
pacific
soywhich
is
currently
producing
soy
milk
for
other
soy
industries.
they
have
asked
the
canadian
government
to
allow
this
soy
milk
to
be
fortified
with
b12,
zinc,
calcium
and
vitamin
d.
with
this
industry
supporting
such
a
request,
we
are
likely
to
see
fortified
products
on
the
market
by
the
autumn.
this
manoeuvre
will
provide
more
opportunity
for
vegans,
or
those
who
choose
not
to
use
cows
milk,
to
conveniently
obtain
adequate
amounts
of
these
