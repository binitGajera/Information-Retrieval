suit
over
new
pricing**
by
janet
kornblum
november
25,
1996,
6:30
p.m.
pt
america
online
(aol),
already
under
fire
from
17
state
attorneys
general
for
the
way
it
has
implemented
its
new
pricing,
is
now
getting
legal
heat
from
at
least
one
of
its
own
subscribers.
an
aol
subscriber
has
filed
a
class-action
suit
in
new
york
supreme
court
against
the
online
service,
claiming
that
the
its
policy
of
automatically
switching
subscribers
from
their
$9.95
per
month
pricing
plan
to
the
$19.95
plan
violates
new
york
state
law.
the
suit,
filed
by
stephen
dilorenzo,
a
new
york
resident
and
aol
subscriber
represented
by
bragar
&
wexler,
argues
that
the
policy
violates
states
laws
against
deceptive
trade
practices.
the
suit
asks
the
court
to
declare
that
aol
is
engaging
in
deceptive
practices
under
the
state's
law
and
seeks
$7
million
in
damages.
the
suit
comes
at
a
time
when
aol
is
negotiating
with
the
attorneys
general
from
17
states
and
one
territory
over
the
pricing
plan.
on
friday,
aol
resolved
the
complaints
of
an
18th
state--washington--when
it
agreed
to
allow
members
to
pick
their
pricing
plan
from
an
opening
splash
screen
that
shows
up
when
users
log
on.
but
the
agreement
apparently
did
not
appease
the
other
attorneys
general
who
are
continuing
to
negotiate
with
aol.
nor
did
it
apparently
resolve
those
of
dilorenzo.
aol's
new
pricing
plan
is
slated
to
take
effect
after
december
1,
when
the
member's
billing
cycle
begins.
it
will
automatically
replace
the
current
plan
that
gives
users
five
hours
of
service
for
$9.95
a
month
with
a
flat-rate
plan
that
provides
unlimited
service
for
$19.95
per
month.
under
the
current
plan,
users
pay
$2.95
for
each
additional
hour,
a
pricing
scheme
that
has
cost
many
users
a
lot
more
than
$19.95.
many
members
have
applauded
aol's
move
to
provide
unlimited
access
for
$19.95,
but
the
way
aol
has
implemented
the
new
prices
has
come
under
fire
from
legal
experts
and
users
alike.
critics
say
that
aol
should
have
asked
users
to
choose
whether
they
wanted
the
new
plan
rather
than
being
switched
automatically.
aol
will
allow
users
to
retain
their
current
pricing
if
they
go
to
the
new
pricing
area
on
aol--an
area
users
say
is
difficult
to
find--and
select
the
current
plan.
but
everybody
else
will
start
being
charged
$19.95
as
of
their
billing
date
in
december.
because
of
the
washington
agreement,
aol
users
now
are
presented
with
a
choice
to
switch
to
the
$19.95
plan
or
choose
"other
options"
when
they
log
on.
the
new
screen
will
mention
the
$9.95
plan
on
the
second
screen.
anyone
who
doesn't
log
on
in
before
their
december
billing
date
theoretically
might
not
know
about
the
new
pricing
until
they
get
their
next
bill.
this
part,
where
users
will
be
upgraded
to
the
higher
priced
plan
if
they
happen
not
to
log
on,
is
what
dilorenzo
is
characterizing
as
deceptive
marketing.
aol
would
not
immediately
comment
on
the
suit.
