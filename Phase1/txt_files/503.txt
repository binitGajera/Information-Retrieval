protection**

pt
digital
watermarking
is
a
popular
new
way
to
protect
copyrighted
images.
here's
how
it
works:

|
**step
1:**
**watermark
created**
the
image
creator
"stamps"
the
image
with
a
digital
watermark
that
can
only
be
viewed
with
special
software.
the
watermark
takes
advantage
of
the
variation
between
pixels
to
remain
all
but
invisible
in
the
finished
product.
the
watermark
can
still
be
detected
with
the
special
software
even
after
the
image
is
printed
and
rescanned.
---|---
**step
2:**
**watermark
detected**
image
editors
such
as
photoshop
4.0
are
equipped
with
the
special
software.
the
application
can
detect
the
subtle
pixel
variation
and
interprets
it
as
a
watermark,
alerting
the
viewer
that
the
image
has
been
copyrighted.
**step
3:**
**artist
identified**
in
addition
to
marking
the
image
as
a
copyrighted
work,
the
watermark
contains
information
on
how
to
contact
the
artist.
