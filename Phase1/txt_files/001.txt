in
recognition
of
more
than
two
decades
of
courageous
journalism,
in
defiance
of
political
pressure
and
violence
that
cost
the
life
of
his
associate,
the
committee
to
protect
journalists
will
present
j.
jesus
blancornelas,
editor
of
the
mexican
newspaper
_zeta,_
with
its
prestigious
international
press
freedom
award.
when
blancornelas
and
longtime
colleague
hector
felix
miranda
co-founded
_zeta_
,
a
feisty
weekly
newspaper
in
the
mexico-u.s.
border
city
of
tijuana,
in
1980,
they
set
a
bold
agenda
for
mexican
journalism.
in
a
country
where
the
news
media
had
historically
kowtowed
to
government
interests
and
where
bribe-
taking
among
journalists
was
so
commonplace
that
it
spawned
a
litany
of
catchphrases,
_zeta_
dared
to
provide
what
few
other
mexican
newspapers
had:
hard-hitting
stories
on
mexico
s
most
vexing
problems--official
corruption
and
drug
trafficking.
the
cost
of
_zeta
s
_independence
has
been
high:
felix,
a
popular
columnist
known
as
"felix
the
cat,"
whose
writing
frequently
targeted
the
wealthy
and
powerful,
was
murdered
in
1988.
a
year
before,
unidentified
assailants
riddled
the
_zeta_
office
with
bullets.
and
over
the
years
the
newspaper
has
suffered
waves
of
harassment
ranging
from
confiscation
of
its
issues
to
outright
threats
to
advertisers.
felixs
death
is
one
of
10
cases
documented
by
cpj
over
the
past
decade
of
mexican
journalists
who
were
murdered
in
apparent
reprisal
for
their
work.
in
virtually
every
case,
investigations
have
been
incomplete
or
contradictory,
leaving
key
questions
unresolved
and
leading
suspects
uninvestigated.
_zeta's_
drama
has
played
out
in
one
of
the
most
contentious
and
volatile
regions
of
mexico.
in
1989
baja
california
was
the
first
state
in
mexico
to
elect
an
opposition
governor,
ernesto
ruffo
appel
of
the
center-right
national
action
party,
ending
the
political
monopoly
of
the
ruling
institutional
revolutionary
party
(pri).
blancornelas
and
_zeta_
played
a
pivotal
role
in
this
historic
political
turning
point
by
providing
a
forum
for
opposition
viewpoints
and
subjecting
previous
governments
to
close
investigative
scrutiny.
in
recent
years
tijuana
has
been
one
of
the
bloodiest
battlegrounds
in
mexico
s
ongoing
internecine
drug
war
which
threatens
the
countrys
economic
and
political
stability
as
well
as
its
social
fabric.
tijuana
was
also
the
site
in
1994
of
mexicos
most
traumatic
political
assassination
since
the
tumultuous
aftermath
of
the
1910
revolution,
when
the
pri
presidential
candidate
luis
donaldo
colosio
was
assassinated
after
a
campaign
rally
in
the
working
class
lomas
taurino
neighborhood.
despite
the
risks,
blancornelas
has
not
been
deterred.
largely
inspired
by
his
example,
a
newly
empowered
generation
of
independent,
well-trained
journalists
are
rejecting
the
old
habits
of
self-censorship,
bribe-taking,
and
government
subsidies
to
provide
the
mexican
public
with
more
balanced
coverage
of
the
news.
in
the
spirit
of
the
international
press
freedom
awards,
whose
previous
recipients
have
included
the
courageous
irish
investigative
journalist
veronica
guerin,
assassinated
in
june,
and
other
pioneers
and
guardians
of
a
free
press
who
have
risked
political
persecution
and
personal
hardship,
cpj
is
honored
to
give
an
award
this
year
to
blancornelas.

the
uphill
climb
to
establish
an
independent
voice
in
tijuana
**
blancornelas
and
f
elix
launched
_zeta_
soon
after
losing
control
of
another
tijuana
newspaper,
_abc_
,
which
they
had
started
in
1977.
the
dailys
__
hallmark
was
in-depth
reporting
of
government
corruption.
in
late
1979,
the
paper
was
taken
over
by
a
government-controlled
labor
union
in
a
move
orchestrated
by
baja
gov.
roberto
de
la
madrid,
a
member
of
the
pri.
the
takeover
occurred
after
blancornelas
had
refused
de
la
madrids
demand
that
he
fire
felix,
the
papers
star
columnist.
fearful
that
_zeta_
,
which
picked
up
where
_abc_
left
off,
would
be
a
target
of
government
reprisal,
blancornelas
decided
to
edit
and
publish
the
paper
from
san
diego
for
a
couple
of
years
to
avoid
a
shutdown
by
mexican
authorities,
who
controlled
a
newsprint
monopoly.
meanwhile,
f
elix
stayed
in
tijuana,
writing
irreverent
columns
about
the
backroom
happenings
of
social
and
political
life
in
baja
california.
**felix

in
1988,
f

who
served
as
co-editor
of

,
was
assassinated
while
driving
to
work
along
a
narrow
tijuana
street.
outrage
followed
his
murder.
thousands
attended
the
funeral,
and
an
unusual
alliance
of
tijuana
journalists
and
political
officials
demanded
justice.
they
would
not
allow
this
murder
to
be
left
unsolved
as
had
those
of
many
other
mexican
journalists.
two
employees
of
a
tijuana
racetrack
owned
by
the
son
of
a
powerful
pri
politician
and
power
broker
were
eventually
convicted
of
the
shooting,
and
they
are
currently
serving
prison
sentences.
but
authorities
never
established
a
motive
for
the
assassination,
and
it
is
widely
believed
the
intellectual
authors
remain
at
large.
in
the
wake
of
felixs
murder,
blancornelas
continued
to
print
his
colleagues
name
on
the
masthead
of
_zeta_
and,
in
each
edition,
reproduced
one
of
f
elixs
columns
opposite
a
black
page
that
asked,"who
killed
me?"
in
the
year
following
felixs
murder,
several
journalists
found
their
careers
threatened
when
they
criticized
how
the
case
was
being
handled.
five
reporters
were
fired
from
the
daily
_el
herald_
after
they
published
a
special
edition
critical
of
the
investigation.

were
given
unplanned"vacations"
after
opening
their
morning
talk
shows
to
callers
critical
of
the
police
investigation.
and
other
journalists
said
they
felt
subtle
pressures
to
tone
down
coverage
of
the
case.
**blancornelas
sets
precedent
for
mexican
journalists
fighting
government
control
of
press**
with
both
_abc_
and
_zeta_
,
blancornelas
insisted
that
his
newspapers
not
be
beholden
to
anyone.
in
an
effort
to
bypass
one
of
the
most
onerous
government
controls
over
the
press--a
requirement
that
all
newsprint
be
purchased
directly
from
the
mexican
governments
newsprint
monopoly--
blancornelas
went
to
san
diego
in
1981,
and
there
printed
_zeta_
and
exported
it
to
tijuana.
according
to
blancornelas,
mexican
authorities
could
not
block
_zeta
s
_import
because
they
would
have
been
forced
to
do
the
same
with
u.s.
publications
entering
the
country.
in
1990,
mexican
president
carlos
salinas
decided
to
sell
the
newsprint
monopoly,
enabling
newspapers
to
buy
newsprint
directly
from
foreign
manufacturers.
but
the
lingering
fear
of
government
interference
remains,
and
some
mexican
newspapers
have
opted
to
publish
on
the
u.s.
side
of
the
border.
newspapers
in
hermosillo,
sonora,
for
instance,
are
printed
in
tucson,
arizona,
and
some
papers
in
ciudad
juarez,
chihuahua,
are
printed
in
el
paso,
texas.
blancornelas
has
also
been
an
inspiring
figure
for
those
mexican
journalists
eager
to
break
the
bribe-taking
habits
of
their
predecessors.
as
late
as
1989,
it
was
still
common
practice
for
reporters,
editors,
and
columnists
to
take
money
from
elected
officials,
government
bureaucrats
and
businessmen
in
exchange
for
flattering
profiles
or
uncritical
coverage.
from
_zeta
s_
founding
in
1980,
blancornelas
made
__
the
papers
__
policy
clear:
bribe-
taking
is
unacceptable.
the
slightest
suspicion
of
bribe-taking
is
cause
for
dismissal,
blancornelas
says,
and
to
date
no
cases
have
come
to
light.
"[journalists]
make
good
money
here.
they
dont
need
it
[bribes],"
he
said.
_zeta
s_
example
has
helped
bring
about
a
sea
change
in
the
way
mexican
journalists
do
business
and
how
they
view
their
role.
in
1990,
baja
california
gov.
ruffo
prohibited
state
officials
from
offering
government
bribes
to
journalists.
former
mexican
president
carlos
salinas
de
gortari
enacted
a
similar
policy
among
his
cabinet.
as
a
result,
says
blancornelas,"
the
tradition-bound
daily
newspapers
have
no
other
recourse
but
to
change
their
tainted
politics,
speak
the
truth,
and
learn
to
survive
through
advertising
and
circulation
sales
or
die."
blancornelas
refusal
to
abide
by
the
status
quo,
which
has
shackled
and
silenced
mexicos
press,
has
helped
myriad
publishers,
editors,
and
reporters
find
the
courage
to
build
a
free
and
independent
press
there.
throughout
mexico,
blancornelas
has
been
recognized
as
a
pioneer,
a
rare
example
of
courage
and
independence
in
the
provincial
press
for
more
than
two
decades.
