pt
most
computer
users
do
not
consider
the
online
world
a
replacement
for
other
sources
of
entertainment,
according
to
a
survey
from
intelliquest's
worldwide
internet/online
tracking
service
in
which
just
17
percent
of
respondents
described
cyberspace
"always"
or
"usually"
better
than
than
television.
conducted
in
april
and
may,
the
study
covers
the
home
and
business
use
of
people
16
and
older
in
the
u.s.
some
of
the
conclusions
are
as
follows:
fifty-four
percent
of
the
16-and-over
population
use
a
computer,
including
at
home,
work,
or
school.
of
computer
users,
32
percent
ventured
online
in
the
three
months
prior
to
being
interviewed,
which
projects
to
35
million
user
of
the
internet
or
online
services.
nearly
half
of
those
who
go
online,
about
15
million,
said
they
are
connected
no
more
than
2
hours
per
week.
of
the
remaining
20
million
users,
about
8
million
access
from
home
and
are
online
more
than
5
hours
per
week,
an
important
statistic
for
those
looking
to
exploit
the
internet
as
a
home
entertainment
medium.
the
survey
drew
no
comparisons
between
the
internet
and
printed
entertainment,
although
61
percent
described
themselves
as
"avid"
readers
of
books.
the
survey
also
confirmed
some
of
the
conventional
wisdom
concerning
the
net:
64
percent
of
users
are
male,
46
percent
are
college-educated,
and
60
percent
have
household
incomes
over
$50,000.
putting
the
numbers
against
a
larger
backdrop,
the
survey
found
that
35
percent
of
all
full-time
u.s.
students
16
and
over
are
online,
compared
with
only
4
percent
of
unemployed
or
retired
people.
only
14
percent
of
all
small-
business
employees
use
online
services.
webmasters
might
be
interested
to
know
that
26
percent
of
users
"always"
use
a
search
engine
and
13
percent
"always"
use
bookmarks
(although
44
percent
"never"
use
them,
most
likely
the
same
people
who
refuse
to
use
a
map
or
read
instruction
manuals).
other
findings
included:
75
percent
used
email
in
the
month
before
their
interview;
69
percent
accessed
the
web;
52
percent
went
online
to
obtain
general
news;
49
percent
sought
out
information
about
"specific
products
and
services;"
32
percent
read
an
online
magazine;
31
percent
downloaded
shareware
or
freeware;
and
7
percent
attempted
an
online
banking
transaction,
the
same
number
that
accessed
adult
entertainment.
